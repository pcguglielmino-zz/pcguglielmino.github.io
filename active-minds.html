													Throughout my life mental health has been important to me. That is why I joined Active Minds, 
													the club on campus dedicated to raising awareness about mental health and suicide prevention. 
													As a sophomore I ran to be Vice President of the organization and was elected, which put me in 
													charge of all of the internal affairs of the club. As a result of my changes to how general body 
													meetings were run I saw an improvement in member satisfaction and turnout, as measured by end 
													of meeting surveys. These surveys also allowed for me to have feedback on the changes I was making 
													and ensured that the members of the club were getting their needs met.

												<h3>Promote advocacy in a new normal</h3>
												<p>
													Last year I ran to be president of the club and was elected. As president my primary 
													goal was to continue the growth that I had seen in the previous year and promote more 
													outreach on campus. Unfortunately, with the coronavirus pandemic we are unable to put 
													on the events that we had planned. However, as a result of the pandemic mental health 
													has become much more focal in peopleâ€™s minds, and we have been working on ways to leverage 
													this cultural moment in order to provide awareness and support to our campus community 
													in ways that we were unable to before. I am currently leading my exec team to plan and 
													implement events during this new normal, as well as creating a new structure for our weekly 
													meetings in order to provide the same opportunities to all students regardless of if they are on campus or not.
