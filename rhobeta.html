													Earlier this year I was elected to be the president of Rho Beta Epsilon. 
													The robotics honor society founded at WPI. Currently we are only a single 
													chapter at our school, but I campaigned on being able to expand Rho Beta Epsilon to other 
													schools so that we could take the next steps in becoming a nationally recognized honor society. 
													After becoming president, I looked at what the previous executive board had done in terms of 
													becoming a national chapter and was disappointed in what was prepared. I realized that in order 
													for our chapter to actually expand to become a national chapter there would need to be long 
													term plans set in place that could be realized over the course of multiple exec boards.

												<h3>Leading for the future</h3>
												<p>
													After realizing this, I met with my exec board and laid out the situation as I saw it, 
													and asked for their input. We eventually concluded that becoming a nationally recognized 
													honor society is not something that can be done all at once, and that our focus should be 
													to lay a solid foundation for future exec to use to become a national honor society. 
													Unfortunately the coronavirus pandemic caused us to halt our regularly scheduled honor 
													society functions for a time, but it also provided a blessing for us to use the time to 
													focus on developing a robust plan for becoming a national chapter and answering all of 
													the questions that we had. I took this time as president to outline all of my thoughts in 
													a report that highlighted our goals and the steps that we need to take in order to achieve 
													these goals. This has proven to be an invaluable resource to our organization and development.
