												<p>
													Throughout my studies at WPI I have worked on multiple projects, some for classes, 
													and others for personal work. Some topics of these projects include mobile robots, 
													artificial intelligence, web development, CNC machining, underwater robotics, 
													soft robotics, and cooking. I won’t go over all of them here, but I will highlight 
													some that I am most proud of.

												<h3>Graduate level projects</h3>
												<p>
													I would like to highlight two of the projects that I worked on when going for my master’s degree. 
													The first one was done when taking my graduate level robot dynamics class. The goal for the 
													project was to create a robotic Stewart platform that could be dynamically controlled in order 
													to playback simulated organ motion. The goal of this platform was to allow for surgeons to 
													practice surgery on moving tissue without having to actually work on any living organisms. 
													For this project I was specifically working on the simulations and modelling for the Stewart 
													platform in gazebo, as well as the system integration for putting the entire project together.
												</p>
												<p>
													I also worked on creating a novel underwater soft robot. The goal of this robot was to use shape 
													memory allow coils to compress a tube that would propel through the water with peristaltic motion. 
													The benefits of using shape memory alloy underwater is that it can be easily cooled, which is one 
													of the main challenges to shape memory alloy normally. This project did not end up fully formed due 
													to time constraints and being unable to update the silicone tube to have different dimensions. 
													However, I learned a lot about shape memory alloy and was able to update the labs shape memory 
													alloy manufacturing process to be more effective.

												<h3>Personal Projects</h3>
													Beyond technical work, I sometimes do other projects in my spare time. 
													The one I want to highlight is a cooking experiment that I did after reading 
													the following quote on Wikipedia: “Gluten forms when glutenin molecules cross-link 
													via disulfide bonds to form a submicroscopic network attached to gliadin, which 
													contributes viscosity (thickness) and extensibility to the mix.” Now, in freshman 
													year I took a materials science class where I learned about the vulcanization of rubber, 
													where sulfur is added to raw rubber in order to create more disulfide bonds and increase 
													its durability. So naturally, seeing the words disulfide bonds in the Wikipedia article for 
													gluten, I asked myself “Can I make bread rubber?” and after a quick amazon order for sulfur 
													and some baking supplies I had my answer. Not really. Which was disappointing, but after 
													further research I found that what makes the disulfide bonds in bread is actually the proteins 
													found in the flour, so while increasing the amount of sulfur in the bread seemed to have a 
													small impact on the properties of the bread, what really had the most impact was buying either 
													bread flour instead of all purpose flour. The more you know!
