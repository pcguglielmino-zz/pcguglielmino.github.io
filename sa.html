													Starting my sophomore year, I was chosen to be a Student Assistant for the sophomore level robotics classes. 
													This means that I am responsible for helping sophomore students learn and understand the material in their classes and labs. 
													As a student assistant I have led review sessions in order to assist students in understanding the topics that will
													be covered before their quizzes and exams. I have also worked with professors and other student assistants to create
													resources to assist in teaching this material to new student. As a result of the effort that I put into being
													a student assistant, I consistently get ranked highly on my end of semester surveys that are provided for each SA.

												<h3>How I try to excel</h3>
												<p>
													At the end of last year, I was chosen to be the Head SA for the robotics engineering department at WPI.
													This means that I would be in charge of making sure that all the SA’s are acting appropriately and 
													handle any concerns from students, professors, or SA’s that need to have a student vouch for them. 
													Unfortunately, due to budget cuts caused by the coronavirus pandemic I was unable to take on the 
													new position and am remaining a student assistant for the sophomore level classes. However, this has not 
													stopped my drive to help the department. As the Rho Beta Epsilon president I also act as a student 
													representative for the department and am using that role to help to produce a survey that can be used to 
													evaluate the entire student body and provide recommendations to the department to help them make decisions going forward.
