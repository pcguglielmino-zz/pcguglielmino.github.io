													Over the course of my education, I realized that I wanted to explore robotics 
													engineering at a deeper level than provided by my undergraduate education. 
													Because of this I am pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Robotics Engineering at WPI. 
													This has allowed me to explore specialized robotics topics such as smart materials, 
													swarm robotics, and to dive deeper into topics such as controls and dynamics
												</p>

												<h3>Why did I chose this project?</h3>
												<p>
													As a requirement for my masters degree I chose to write a thesis. When choosing a thesis 
													I thought of what I enjoyed studying during my robotics curriculum, and the topics that 
													stood out to me were robotic materials and controls. Because of this, I found a project that 
													was focused on developing a control system for a quadcopter drone with a flexible body. 
													This is valuable because there are things that a flexible bodied drone can do that regular 
													drones are unable to do, and as more research is put into it there may be even more capabilities 
													that are discovered. Also being able to work with controlling robotic materials will allow 
													for possible PhD research in the field which is something I am considering.
												</p>

												<h3>What have I done so far?</h3>
												<p>
													I have just started working on the thesis recently, but I have set up the gazebo environment
													with a model rigid body quadcopter and am currently working on developing an LQR controller 
													for it. After this LQR controller is developed then I will start adding additional features to 
													the simulated drone, such as tilting rotors and the flexible fuselage. As the simulated model gets 
													closer to reality, I will update the controller and evaluate its effectiveness. Once the LQR 
													controller can fully control the simulated drone, it will move onto the physical drone for further testing. 
													If that is successful, and there is enough time, then different types of controllers will be investigated.
